# Overview

## Background:
Complete rehabilitation and recovery from concussion in an athlete population includes a sucessful reintegration to sport participation. The proportion of patients who participate in sports in the months that follow symptom resolution is unknown, as are the injury, recovery, or demographic characteristics that differentiate patients who do and do not return to sport participation soon after recovery. An improved understanding of such factors may inform clinicians in early identification of patients at risk of delayed sport participation, and may reveal strategies for more successful sport reintegration in the future. 

**Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)** is a neuroimaging approach that measures concentrations of various neurometabolites (chemicals) in the brain. For example, Myo-Inositol is often used as a marker of glial cell activity, increasing in concentrations when oxidative stress is present or neurons are damaged. Choline is essential for cell membrane support and is a precursor for neurotransmitter synthesis. Glutamate-Glutamine are excitatory neurotransmitters involved in executive functioning tasks and also serves as an important energy source for neurons when recovering from injury. And Glutathione is an anti-oxidant that responds to oxidative stress in damaged cells. In measuring these neurometabolites, researchers can gain insight into the chemical changes occurring post-injury and can more objectively quantify physiological responses to rehabilitation.  

The relationships between these neurometabolites and post-concussion exercise behaviors may better inform the underlying mechanisms by which exercise contributes to concussion recovery.  

## Objective:
Our **primary objective** was to compare neurometabolite concentrations of Myo-Inositol, Choline, Glutamate-Glutamine, and Glutathione at two timepoints in concussion recovery: initially within 21-days of injury when patients are still symptomatic, and again within 5-days of physician clearance to return-to-sport (i.e., no longer symptomatic).  

Our **secondary objective** was to investigate how exercise behaviors at various points in recovery are associated with these four neurometabolites.
