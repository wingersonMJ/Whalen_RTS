# Overview

## Background:
Complete rehabilitation and recovery from concussion in an athlete population includes a successful reintegration to sport participation. The proportion of patients who participate in sports in the months that follow symptom resolution is unknown, as are the injury, recovery, or demographic characteristics that differentiate patients who do and do not return to sport participation soon after recovery. An improved understanding of such factors may inform clinicians in early identification of patients at risk of delayed sport participation and may reveal strategies for more successful sport reintegration in the future. 


## Objective:
Our **primary objective** was to describe sport participation among a sample of adolescents who were followed longitudinally from concussion to 3-months post-symptom resolution. 

Our **secondary objective** was to investigate clinical, injury, and demographic characteristics that differed among participants who did and did not report sport participation in the 1 to 3 months after injury.
